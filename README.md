# README for Homies on Rails Project 6, Peer Evaluation Tool.

For this project, Homies on Rails implemented a Peer Evaluation Tool that allows instructors to create an account to do the following:

* Create a Course
* Assign groups to a course
* Add students to their groups
* Easily view the feedback and ratings students are giving each other within their teams

As a student, you will have the following functionality:

* View the members of your groups
* View the projects and description of projects for your group
* Give feedback and ratings to other members of your team

Then run "rails db:migrate" to create the tables of the database for our project. Finally, run "rails server" and open the application on firefox with link "localhost/3000"
